    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support user authentication and profile management for the PetConnect application. It prioritizes Authorization Independence by avoiding hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules. User profiles are stored in a dedicated collection (`users`) using their unique user ID as the document ID. This structure enables simple, path-based security rules for user profile access, ensuring only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile. This eliminates the need to denormalize any authorization data. The `users/{userId}` path structure naturally supports QAPs because list operations are inherently scoped to the user's own data. There are no global roles or collaborative data requirements. The `pets` collection is a top-level collection to store pet profiles, with an `ownerId` field to link back to the user."
